How to play

1. Hit start button to enter the game (Awesome)

2. Simply type in any word you can think of from the list of given characters (Yahoo!)

3. Corrected word from the game's dictionary will be listed out

Even if the word is correct, it may not valid as the dictionary does not contain it (Do not blame me! Blame the one who make this dictionary)
4. The game will present new list of characters whenever player digs out all words (Getting bored ?)

5. Get uk off! Just hit "Give up" button, buddy all the sh!t will pop out (and sometimes real sh!t is better than this sh!t)
