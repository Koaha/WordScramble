**1. Hit start button to enter the game** (Awesome)

**2. Simply type in any word you can think of from the list of given characters** (Yahoo!)

**3. Corrected word from the game's dictionary will be listed out** 
   * Even if the word is correct, it may not valid as the dictionary does not contain it
   (Do not blame me! Blame the one who make this dictionary)

**4. The game will present new list of characters whenever player digs out all words** (Getting bored ?)

**5. Get *u*k off! Just hit "Give up" button, buddy all the sh!t will pop out** (and sometimes real sh!t is better than this sh!t)
