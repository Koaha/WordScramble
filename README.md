## 🔧 Setting Up the Client Side

### Step 1: Install Grunt
> `npm install grunt --save-dev`

Grunt is here to do all the heavy lifting. Get it in there!

### Step 2: Add Some Proxy Magic

This game chats through proxies. Don’t ask why – just roll with it.

### Step 3: Get Into the Client Folder & Load Dependencies
> `cd client`  
> `npm install`

Dependencies galore! Your client folder’s about to get loaded.

### Step 4: Bring in the Bower Backup

> `bower install`

Boom! Extra front-end goodies coming right up.

## 🔨 Setting Up the Server Side

[Get the Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/), because this server doesn’t lift itself. It’ll be dancing on port 9090.

1. **Hit the Start Button**  
   Start your adventure, if you dare. (It’s kinda awesome.)

2. **Type Words Like a Maniac**  
   Find any word from the jumbled letters. Yes, *any*. This dictionary is picky.

3. **Cross Your Fingers**  
   - If it’s in the dictionary, you score. If not, well… blame the dictionary maker.

4. **When You’re Done, Hit “Give Up”**  
   - See all the words you missed, just for fun. Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

5. **Find a New Hobby**  
   - Or play again and keep scrambling!
